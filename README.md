Tic Tac Toe Game
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This simple web-based game allows two players to play the classic Tic Tac Toe on their browser. The game is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

How to Play
Open the index.html file in your web browser to start the game.
The game will display a 3x3 grid representing the Tic Tac Toe board.
Player 1 is represented by "X" and Player 2 by "O".
The players take turns to place their symbols on the board until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
If all the cells on the board are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
Game Logic
The game logic is implemented in JavaScript. The board state is represented as an array, and the game checks for winning conditions and draws after each move. The players take turns and cannot overwrite each other's moves.

The winning conditions are checked for each player's moves on the board. If a winning condition is met, the game displays a message declaring the winner. If all cells are filled and no winning condition is met, the game declares a draw.
